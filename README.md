# 🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates multiple linear regression on the classic **Boston Housing Dataset** using Python.

## 📂 About the Dataset
The dataset contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the Boston area. Key features include:
- `CRIM`: Crime rate per town
- `RM`: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- `LSTAT`: % lower status population
- `TAX`, `PTRATIO`, `DIS`, and more...

## 🚀 What This Project Covers
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Splitting dataset for training and testing
- Linear Regression model training using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² score
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted and Feature Importance

## 📊 Sample Output

- **R² Score**: (varies based on split)
- **RMSE**: (depends on model fitting)
